# Releasenotes Rivine v1.0.6

If you apply this update directly from release v1.0.5,
than please also take into account the changes that were already released with the patched version of v1.0.5.

You can find the release notes for `v1.0.5-patch` at: [/doc/release_notes/v1.0.5_patch.md](/doc/release_notes/v1.0.5_patch.md).

## Summary

- Bug fixes and improvements;
- MultiSignature condition/fulfillment to allow MultiSig wallets;
- Detailed documentation about MultiSig;
- Raw JSON-encoded conditions can now be used instead of addresses in wallet send sub commands of the CLI client;
- Locked and unlocked unspent outputs can now be listed using the `wallet list` sub commands of the CLI client;

## Upgrade concerns

- the `--legacy` and `--locktime` flags have been removed from the wallet send commands as well as the fact that the REST `POST /wallet/coin` and `POST /wallet/blockstakes` no longer take a version as argument. If your technology does still give a version argument, not to worry, it will simply be ignored, and `version: 1` will be used instead, as should have been your choice already anyhow;
- The CLI client no longer supports the creation of v0 transactions, but can still understand them when already created;
